## Types of support for business decision-making

### Strategic
#### Strategic decision-making is when a business is impacting something that will achieve long-term goals and a longer-term vision. This usually affects the shape and the direction of the whole business and is it aligned with the company objective. These are generally made by senior managers. It requires out of the box thinking as managers need to consider possible future scenarios that may or may not happen. It is these scenarios that will determine in which direction a company will go. So, for example, a business can make strategic decisions that will them make them the top product manufacturers; in such a case the business will then likely concentrate more on producing consumer focused products. Overall, a firm will only be able to progress more if it has taken the necessary strategic decisions. Additionally, whether the decisions were correct or incorrect, this can only be verified over a long period of time. Of course, if the decisions were correct, this mean it will be great insight for future decisions, which then can improve the companyâ€™s business and will become very successful. But if the decisions were not so great, this will be a great downfall for the company which can cause major problems with financing.

### Tactical
#### Tactical decision-making is related to the implementation of strategic decisions. These decisions are taken at the middle level of management. When making tactical decisions, the company as a whole is involved. They are directed towards developing divisional plans, structuring workflows, establishing distribution channels, acquisition of resources such as materials and money. A misguided strategy could take a business in entirely the incorrect direction which then can lead to failure, whilst a misguided tactic would only have a more limited impact to the company. Tactical decisions can tend to be more changeable unlike strategic. With tactical decision-making, this allows a company to evaluate its infrastructure and how it performs which then allows adjustments made accordingly. A tactical decision is made by first have the board analyse all the information that is presented, they then determine an immediate course of action with the intention of achieving a specific goal that will benefit most staff and clients.

### Operational

#### Operational decision-making is mainly related to the day-to-day operations of the company. They are decisions that are mainly short-term based as they are done repeatedly. They are also based of facts that are related to events that usually do not require a huge amount of business judgement. These decisions are decided by the lower levels of management. Good operational decisions will have measurable results such as higher revenues, increased profits, increased productivity and customer satisfaction. The countless interactions that take place on a daily basis represent the result of operational decisions. These decisions therefore, can halt an organisation and make it unproductive. To prevent this, operational decisions should be consistent with strategic decisions. An example of a simple operational decision would be when the manager at a cafe has to order more stock for next week. Because the stock and sales data show that they will need more since there has been an increase in customers during that week.
