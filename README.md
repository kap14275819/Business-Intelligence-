## Types of support for business decision-making

### Strategic

### Tactical

### Operational


Strategic decisions are long-term in their impact. They affect and shape the direction of the whole business. They are generally made by senior managers. The managers of the bakery need to take a strategic decision about whether to remain in the cafe business. Long-term forecasts of business turnover set against likely market conditions will help to determine if it should close the cafe business.
Tactical decisions help to implement the strategy. They are usually made by middle management. For the cafe, a tactical decision would be whether to open earlier in the morning or on Saturday to attract new customers. Managers would want research data on likely customer numbers to help them decide if opening hours should be extended.
Operational decisions relate to the day-to-day running of the business. They are mainly routine and may be taken by middle or junior managers. For example, a simple operational decision for the cafe would be whether to order more coffee for next week. Stock and sales data will show when it needs to order more supplies.
