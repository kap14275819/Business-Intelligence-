## Types of support for business decision-making

### Strategic
#### Strategic decision-making is when a business is impacting something that will achieve long-term goals and a longer term vision. This usually affects the shape and the direction of the whole business and it is aligned with the company objective. These are generally made by senior managers. It requires out of the box thinking as managers need to consider possible future scenarios that may or may not happen. It is these scenarios that will determine in which direction a company will go. So for example, a business can make strategic decisions that will them make them the top product manufacturers; in such a case the business will then likely concentrate more on producing consumer focused products. Overall, a firm will only be able to progress more if it has taken the necessary strategic decisions. Additionally, whether the decisions were correct or incorrect, this can only be verified over a long period of time. Of course if the decisions were correct, this mean it will be great insight for future decisions, which then can improve the companys business and will become very successful. But if the decisions were not so great, this will be a great downfall for the company which can cause major problems with financing. 

### Tactical
#### Tactical decision-making is related to the implementation of strategic decisions

### Operational


Tactical decisions help to implement the strategy. They are usually made by middle management. 

These decisions relate to the implementation of strategic decisions. They are directed towards developing divisional plans, structuring workflows, establishing distribution channels, acquisition of resources such as men, materials and money. These decisions are taken at the middle level of management.

Tactical decision making is a business strategy where decisions are made with the end result of ensuring a company is as successful as possible, according to Blue Collar University. This means the company makes decisions that will contribute to the longevity, profitability, and continued improvement of all areas of operation.

Tactical decision making focuses on the big picture and the here and now. When making tactical decisions, the company as a whole is involved, according to Chron.com Small Business. Tactical decision making allows a company to evaluate its infrastructure and how it operates and make adjustments accordingly. To make a tactical decision, a board analyzes information it is presented, and determines an immediate course of action with the intention of achieving a specific goal that will directly and immediately benefit the most people. A study by npower suggests that although they do involve many people and departments, tactical decisions tend to have a limited impact in the case of their failure because they can be adjusted and changed relatively quickly, according to Business Case Studies.






These decisions relate to day-to-day operations of the enterprise. They have a short-term horizon as they are taken repetitively. These decisions are based on facts regarding the events and do not require much of business judgement. Operational decisions are taken at lower levels of management. As the information is needed for helping the manager to take rational, well informed decisions, information systems need to focus on the process of managerial decision making.

Operational decisions relate to the day-to-day running of the business. They are mainly routine and may be taken by middle or junior managers. For example, a simple operational decision for the cafe would be whether to order more coffee for next week. Stock and sales data will show when it needs to order more supplies.
