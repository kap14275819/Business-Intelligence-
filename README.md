## Types of support for business decision-making

### Strategic
#### Strategic decision-making is when a business is impacting something that will achieve long-term goals and a longer term vision. This usually affects the shape and the direction of the whole business and it is aligned with the company objective. These are generally made by senior managers. It requires out of the box thinking as managers need to consider possible future scenarios that may or may not happen. It is these scenarios that will determine in which direction a company will go. So for example, a business can make strategic decisions that will them make them the top product manufacturers; in such a case the business will then likely concentrate more on producing consumer focused products. Overall, a firm will only be able to progress more if it has taken the necessary strategic decisions. Additionally, whether the decisions were correct or incorrect, this can only be verified over a long period of time. Of course if the decisions were correct, this mean it will be great insight for future decisions, which then can improve the companys business and will become very successful. But if the decisions were not so great, this will be a great downfall for the company which can cause major problems with financing. 

### Tactical

### Operational


Tactical decisions help to implement the strategy. They are usually made by middle management. For the cafe, a tactical decision would be whether to open earlier in the morning or on Saturday to attract new customers. Managers would want research data on likely customer numbers to help them decide if opening hours should be extended.

These decisions relate to the implementation of strategic decisions. They are directed towards developing divisional plans, structuring workflows, establishing distribution channels, acquisition of resources such as men, materials and money. These decisions are taken at the middle level of management.








These decisions relate to day-to-day operations of the enterprise. They have a short-term horizon as they are taken repetitively. These decisions are based on facts regarding the events and do not require much of business judgement. Operational decisions are taken at lower levels of management. As the information is needed for helping the manager to take rational, well informed decisions, information systems need to focus on the process of managerial decision making.

Operational decisions relate to the day-to-day running of the business. They are mainly routine and may be taken by middle or junior managers. For example, a simple operational decision for the cafe would be whether to order more coffee for next week. Stock and sales data will show when it needs to order more supplies.
